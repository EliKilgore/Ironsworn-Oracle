## General info
This is a simple program to automate the oracle tables for the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game by Shawn Tomkin. The tables I used in this program were written by him.

The first oracle will generate an NPC character with a name, two descriptors, a role and a goal. 

I plan on adding oracles to generate regions, settlements, and delve sites.

## Technologies
The project was created with Javascript.

## Setup
To be honest, I still havent figured out how to get it running outside of Visual Studio. I'll get back to this.
