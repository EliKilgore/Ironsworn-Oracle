# Ironsworn-Oracle

Hi, I'm still learning the ins and outs of Javascript, so to help me learn I decided to build a simple program to automate the oracle tables for the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying
game by Shawn Tomkin. 

The first oracle will generate an NPC character with a name, two descriptors, a role and a goal. 

I plan on adding oracles to generate regions, settlements, and delve sites.
