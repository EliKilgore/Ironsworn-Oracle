Hi
This is a simple program I am testing to automate the oracle tables from the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying game by Shawn Tomkin. 

My first goal was to build a character oracle that would generate a single character with a name, two descriptors, a role, and a goal. If this works well, I intend to add additional functionality to make the character more or less complicated.
